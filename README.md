# Music Generation Application ðŸŽµ

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for generating music using natural language prompts. The application uses transformer-based models from the Hugging Face library to generate audio files based on user-provided descriptions.

## Features
- **Music Generation**: Enter a prompt describing the type of music you want, and the app will generate an audio file.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from different pre-trained models (`facebook/musicgen-small`, `facebook/musicgen-medium`, `facebook/musicgen-large`).
- **Save Output**: Save the generated music file in `.wav` format to a location of your choice.
- **Example Prompts**: Use predefined example prompts for quick testing.
- **Help Menu**: Learn how to use the application through the built-in help menu.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vineet_kurapati/music-generation-app.git
   cd music-generation-app
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Enter a prompt in the text box (e.g., "A relaxing piano melody").
5. Select a model from the dropdown menu.
6. Click **Generate Music**.
7. Choose a save location for the generated `.wav` file.
8. Enjoy the generated music! ðŸŽ¶

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for downloading models

## Dependencies
- `transformers`: For using Hugging Face's `facebook/musicgen` models.
- `pydub`: For audio playback.
- `scipy`: For saving audio files.
- `tkinter`: For building the GUI.
- `ffmpeg`: Required by `pydub` for audio file processing. Install it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Example Prompts
- "A relaxing piano melody"
- "Energetic electronic beats"
- "A serene orchestral piece"

## Logging
The application logs all activities, including errors and successful operations, in the `musicgen.log` file.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error loading models**: Ensure you have an active internet connection to download the required model weights.
- **Playback issues**: Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and properly configured in your system PATH.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for audio playback directly within the app.
- Provide more control over generation parameters, such as duration and style.

Enjoy your music generation journey!

### `requirements.txt`

```plaintext
transformers==4.35.0
pydub==0.25.1
scipy==1.11.3
```

### Notes:
1. Replace `"yourusername"` in the GitHub clone URL in the `README.md` with your GitHub username if you plan to host this on GitHub.
2. Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and in your system PATH since it is required for `pydub` to handle audio playback.
3. The `transformers` library version mentioned is the latest stable version as of this writing. You can adjust it based on your needs.
